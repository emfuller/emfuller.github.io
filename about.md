Iâ€™m a PhD student with [Simon Levin](http://www.princeton.edu/~slevin/) at Princeton in the Department of [Ecology & Evolutionary Biology](http://www.princeton.edu/eeb/). 

I like to work on applied problems (e.g. problems due to predators, livestock, fishing, and agricultural practices) by understanding the theoretical ecological, and sometimes economic, principles which underlie and perpetuate these issues.

Right now I work mostly on commercial fishing on the US West coast.

I just graduated with a PhD from Princeton in the Department of [Ecology & Evolutionary Biology](http://www.princeton.edu/eeb/). My advisor was [Simon Levin](http://www.princeton.edu/~slevin/). 

I like to work on applied problems (e.g. problems due to predators, livestock, fishing, and agricultural practices) by understanding the theoretical ecological, and sometimes economic, principles which underlie and perpetuate these issues.

Right now I split my time between working on commercial fishing on the US West coast and using large, high dimensional, unstructured data sets to derive novel insights for farmers as a data science consultant at [Granular](https://www.granular.ag/).

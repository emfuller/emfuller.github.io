In the process of my PhD I have learned so much from people kind enough to put notes, thoughts, and (most importantly) code snippets up on the web. In the dark first couple of years of grad school, I spent a ton of time desperately looking for advice about how to structure my work time in the absence of the structure I had found in college.

I've also learned an absurd amount from people on the web about how to code. I can't overstate my debt to stackoverflow, but people's personal websites continue to be a source of ideas and inspiration.

So while I don't _think_ I have much to add, I'm putting my work out there in the hopes that someone else will learn from the mistakes I'm documenting. :)

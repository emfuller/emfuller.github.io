# Dissertation!
My dissertation is focused on understanding how commercial fishermen affect (and are influenced by) the marine ecosystems from which they harvest. Using a large datasets describing commercial fishing, fish abundance and environmental data, I'm examining the implications of human coupling of disparate marine food webs. 

Collaborators: Jameal Samhouri, James Watson, Emily Klein, Matthieu Barbier, Andrew Tilman

### Range shifts and harvesting: a simple model
This thing is accepted at ecosphere, see [here](#) for the paper!

# Side Projects! 
Collaboration is the best, and I'm pleased to be involved in the following projects. 

## Shifting fish and fishers
As a co-leader of a SESYNC funded graduate student working group, I'm collaborating with social science and fellow ecology grad students to examine how fishermen are responding to climate change in the Northeast US. 

Collaborators: Talia Young, Brad Dubik, Josh Stoll, Kaycee Colman, Mikaela Provost, Adrienne Tecza, Sara Bess Ward, Elizabeth Clark, Kevin St. Martin, Malin Pinsky

## Large Ungulates
Working with Matt Hayes at the University of Wyoming, we're using machine learning approaches to build a flexible classification algorithm to infer parturition events in North American large ungulates from GPS data. 

Collaborators: Matt Hayes

## Lemurs!
Working with Cara Brook we're interested in building age structured models of lemur populations to better understand how bushmeat hunting affects population viability.
